# Feature F4 - Error Management

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)
- [Configuration Feature (F3)](/docs/f3-configuration.blueprint.md)

## Description

Ensures that users receive clear, actionable feedback when errors occur, while maintaining system stability and providing necessary information for troubleshooting. This feature builds upon the configuration system (F3) to provide customizable error handling and logging behavior.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** user
- **I want to:** understand what went wrong and how to fix it
- **So that:** I can continue working effectively

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Handle operational errors
    Given I perform an operation that fails
    When the error occurs
    Then I receive a clear explanation of what went wrong
    And guidance on how to resolve it
    And the system remains stable

Scenario: Handle input validation errors
    Given I provide incorrect input
    When the validation fails
    Then I receive specific feedback about what was wrong
    And examples of correct input
    And the operation does not proceed

Scenario: Debug issues
    Given I encounter a problem
    When I need to troubleshoot
    Then I can access detailed error information
    And understand the context of the error
    And identify the root cause

Scenario: Recover from partial failures
    Given I perform a multi-step operation
    When one step fails
    Then the system handles the failure gracefully
    And maintains data consistency
    And provides a clear status of what succeeded and failed
```

## UI/UX

Error feedback follows consistent patterns:

- Error messages: Clear, concise, and actionable
- Error levels: Differentiated by severity and required action
- Context: Relevant information to understand the error
- Recovery: Clear next steps or alternatives

## Additional Information

Preconditions:
- Error detection mechanisms
- Logging capabilities
- User feedback channels
- Configuration system (F3) for error handling settings

Notes:
- Consistent error message format
- Clear severity levels
- Actionable recovery steps
- Context preservation
- Debug information availability
- Error tracking and reporting
- Configurable error handling behavior
