# Feature F4 - Log Management

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)
- [Configuration Feature (F3)](/docs/f3-configuration.blueprint.md)

## Description

Provides a comprehensive logging system that enables operational monitoring, debugging, and system health tracking. This feature builds upon the configuration system (F3) to provide customizable logging behavior and output formats.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** developer or operator
- **I want to:** track system behavior and diagnose issues
- **So that:** I can maintain system health and performance

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Log system events
    Given I have configured logging
    When a system event occurs
    Then it is logged with appropriate context
    And the log entry includes relevant metadata

Scenario: Configure log levels
    Given I need to adjust logging verbosity
    When I change the log level
    Then only events of the specified level and above are logged
    And the change takes effect immediately

Scenario: Format log output
    Given I need specific log formats
    When I configure the output format
    Then logs are written in the specified format
    And the format is consistent across all log entries

Scenario: Route logs to different destinations
    Given I need to send logs to multiple destinations
    When I configure log routing
    Then logs are sent to all specified destinations
    And each destination receives the appropriate log level
```

## UI/UX

Logging system provides:

- Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON)
- Flexible log routing (console, file)
- Contextual information in logs
- Performance impact monitoring
- Log rotation and retention

## Additional Information

Preconditions:
- Logging configuration
- Output destination setup
- Performance monitoring

Notes:
- Structured logging format
- Configurable log levels
- Multiple output destinations
- Log rotation and retention
- Performance optimization
- Context preservation
- Correlation IDs for tracing
