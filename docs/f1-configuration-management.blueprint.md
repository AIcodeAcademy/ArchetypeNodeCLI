# Feature F1 - Configuration Management

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Provides a robust configuration system supporting environment variables, config files, and command-line arguments with validation and type safety.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** Node.js CLI developer
- **I want to:** manage application configuration through multiple sources
- **So that:** I can easily configure my CLI application with proper validation and type safety

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Load configuration from environment variables
    Given I have set environment variables for my CLI application
    When I start the application
    Then the configuration is loaded from environment variables
    And the values are properly typed and validated

Scenario: Load configuration from config file
    Given I have a configuration file in the project root
    When I start the application
    Then the configuration is loaded from the file
    And the values are properly typed and validated

Scenario: Override configuration with command-line arguments
    Given I have a default configuration
    When I provide command-line arguments
    Then the configuration is overridden with the provided values
    And the values are properly typed and validated
```

## UI/UX

- Command-line interface for configuration management
- Support for configuration file formats (JSON, YAML, TOML)
- Environment variable mapping
- Command-line argument parsing
- Configuration validation and type checking
- Helpful error messages for invalid configurations

## Additional Information

### Dependencies
- Node.js runtime
- Configuration parsing libraries
- Type validation libraries

### Preconditions
- Node.js environment
- Access to file system
- Environment variables access
