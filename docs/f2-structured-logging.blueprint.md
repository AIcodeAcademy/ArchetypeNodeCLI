# Feature F2 - Structured Logging

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Implements a comprehensive logging system with different log levels, formatting options, and output destinations.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** Node.js CLI developer
- **I want to:** implement structured logging in my application
- **So that:** I can effectively monitor and debug my CLI application with proper log levels and formats

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Log messages with different severity levels
    Given I have configured the logging system
    When I log messages with different severity levels (debug, info, warn, error)
    Then the messages are properly formatted and output to the configured destination
    And the severity level is clearly indicated

Scenario: Configure log output destination
    Given I have multiple log output options
    When I configure the logging system to use a specific destination
    Then logs are written to the specified destination
    And the format is appropriate for the destination

Scenario: Include structured data in logs
    Given I have application data to log
    When I log the data with context
    Then the log entry includes structured data
    And the data is properly formatted and searchable
```

## UI/UX

- Command-line interface for log configuration
- Support for multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Support for multiple output formats (text, JSON, structured)
- Support for multiple destinations (console, file, remote)
- Log rotation and management
- Log filtering and search capabilities

## Additional Information

### Dependencies
