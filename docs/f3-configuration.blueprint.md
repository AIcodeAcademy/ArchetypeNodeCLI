### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Enables users to customize the application's behavior to suit their specific needs and environment through various configuration methods.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** user
- **I want to:** customize the application's behavior
- **So that:** it works optimally for my specific needs

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Apply configuration settings
    Given I have defined configuration preferences
    When I use the application
    Then my settings are applied
    And the application behaves according to my preferences

Scenario: Use environment-specific settings
    Given I work in different environments
    When I switch environments
    Then the appropriate settings are automatically applied
    And the application adapts to the current environment

Scenario: Validate configuration
    Given I provide invalid configuration
    When the application starts
    Then I receive clear feedback about the invalid settings
    And the application uses safe defaults
    And I can correct the configuration

Scenario: Manage configuration sources
    Given I have multiple configuration sources
    When the application loads settings
    Then it follows a clear priority order
    And I understand which settings take precedence
```
