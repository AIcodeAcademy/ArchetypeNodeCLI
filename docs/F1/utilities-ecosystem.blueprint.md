# Feature F1 - Utilities ecosystem

Feature Code: F1_utilities-ecosystem

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Provides utilities for accessing Environment, Configuration and Writing Logs with a standardized approach.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** have access to standardized utility functions for environment variables, configuration, and logging
- **So that:** I can quickly build robust CLI applications without recreating common infrastructure code

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Access environment variables through standardized utility
    Given the CLI application is running in a specific environment
    When the developer uses the environment utility to access a variable
    Then the correct environment variable value is returned with proper typing and validation

Scenario: Load and access configuration from a file
    Given a configuration file exists for the CLI application
    When the developer uses the configuration utility to load settings
    Then the settings are parsed, validated and made available as a typed configuration object

Scenario: Write structured logs with different severity levels
    Given the CLI application needs to output informational and error messages
    When the developer uses the logging utility with different severity levels
    Then the messages are formatted according to their severity and written to the appropriate output stream
```

## UI/UX

The utilities will be provided through a modular, functional API that follows TypeScript best practices. Each utility will have a clean, consistent interface with typed inputs and outputs, comprehensive documentation, and built-in error handling.

```markdown
- Environment utility:
  - Functions to get environment variables with type casting and validation
  - Support for required vs optional variables with default values
  
- Configuration utility:
  - Functions to load configuration from files with schema validation
  - Type-safe access to configuration values
  
- Logging utility:
  - Functions for different log levels (info, warn, error, debug)
  - Structured output format with timestamps and log levels
  - Optional colored output using chalk for better readability
```

## Additional Information

Dependencies:
- No external dependencies for environment utilities
- Minimal use of native fs module for configuration loading
- Chalk library for colored log output

The utilities form the foundation of the Archetype Node CLI architecture and will be used by other features. They should follow a functional programming approach with immutable data patterns and pure functions where possible.
