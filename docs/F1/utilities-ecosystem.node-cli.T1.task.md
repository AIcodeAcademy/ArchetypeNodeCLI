# Programming Task: T1

Design and define types for environment variables, configuration, and logging in separate `*.type.ts` files.
docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md

- Plan: [docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md](docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md)

## Context

☣️ make sure to read/copy coding and archetype rules ☣️

- Follow TypeScript best practices: fully typed, annotated, avoid primitive obsession.
- Place types in their own `*.type.ts` files.
- Export only what is needed outside the module.
- Feature: Utilities ecosystem
- Container: node-cli
- Task: T1
- Status: done

## Instructions

☣️ do not place system inside app ☣️

`src/app/system/environment.type.ts`
 - Define types for environment variables, ensuring type safety and clear structure.

`src/app/system/configuration.type.ts`
 - Define types for configuration, representing all expected config structure.

`src/app/system/logging.type.ts`
 - Define types for logging, including log levels, log entry structure, and metadata.

- Ensure all types are fully annotated and avoid primitive obsession.
- Export only what is needed for use by other modules.

## Output

- Change the status of the task to "in_progress", "done" or "failed" in this file.
- Mark this task as done in the docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md after completion.
- Summarize the work done and propose a git commit message in this file.

### Summary

- Created `environment.type.ts` with type-safe environment variable types, constants, and runtime validation.
- Created `configuration.type.ts` with a fully typed configuration structure, file format type, and runtime validation.
- Created `logging.type.ts` with log level types, log entry structure, metadata, and runtime validation.
- All types are fully annotated and avoid primitive obsession.
- No TypeScript errors found in any file.

### Proposed git commit message

feat(types): add fully typed and validated types for environment, configuration, and logging in system modules
