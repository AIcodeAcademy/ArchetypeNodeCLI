# Task 11 for Plan utilities-ecosystem-node-cli

Initialize and configure the utility services (Environment, Configuration, Logger) when the application starts.

**Status**: not started

### Reference

- [Implementation Plan](/docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem-node-cli.plan.md)
- [Feature Blueprint](/docs/F1/utilities-ecosystem.blueprint.md)
- [General coding rules](/.ai/builder/rules/code.rules.md)
- [Node CLI archetype rules](/.ai/builder/rules/node-cli.rules.md)
- Task 8: Environment Service (`src/domain/environment.service.ts`)
- Task 9: Configuration Service (`src/domain/configuration.service.ts`)
- Task 10: Logger Service (`src/domain/logger.service.ts`)
- `src/index.ts` (or the main application entry point)

## Instructions

<!--
  Integrate the utility services into the application's entry point.
  Ensure services are initialized in the correct order (Environment -> Configuration -> Logger).
-->

- `src/app/startup.service.ts` (or similar initialization module)
  - Create the file if it doesn't exist.
  - Import the singleton instances or classes for `EnvironmentService`, `ConfigurationService`, `LoggerService`.
  - Define an asynchronous function `initializeUtilities()`.
  - Inside the function:
    - Instantiate `EnvironmentService` (if not already a Singleton instance). Handle potential errors during environment validation.
    - Instantiate `ConfigurationService` (if not already a Singleton instance). Pass `EnvironmentService` if needed. Call its loading method (e.g., `loadConfiguration`). Handle potential errors during configuration loading/validation.
    - Instantiate `LoggerService` (if not already a Singleton instance). Pass `EnvironmentService` if needed.
    - Export the initialized service instances (or a container/registry object holding them) for use in the rest of the application.
    - Add logging using the initialized `LoggerService` to indicate successful initialization or report errors.
  - Export the `initializeUtilities` function.

- `src/index.ts` (or main entry point)
  - Import `initializeUtilities` from `startup.service.ts`.
  - Call `initializeUtilities()` at the beginning of the application's execution, likely within an async main function.
  - Use a try-catch block to handle any initialization errors and log them (potentially using a basic console log if the logger failed to initialize).
  - Proceed with the rest of the application logic only if initialization succeeds.
