# Programming Task: T1

Implement environment variable access utility with type safety and validation.
planFile: ../utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md

## Context

- Follow the TypeScript coding rules from /.ai/builder/rules/code.rules.md
- Use the Node CLI archetype rules from /.ai/builder/rules/node-cli.rules.md
- This task is part of the F1 Utilities Ecosystem feature for the C1 Node CLI container.
- See the plan at ../utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md for context and task list.
- The utility should provide a functional API to access environment variables, with type safety, validation, and support for required/optional variables and default values.

## Instructions

`src/system/environment.type.ts`
 - Define types for environment variables, including required and optional variables.

`src/system/environment.util.ts`
 - Implement functions to get environment variables with type casting, validation, and default value support.

`src/system/environment.validator.ts`
 - Implement runtime validation functions for environment variables.

- Ensure all code is fully typed and follows the provided coding rules.
- Export only what is needed outside each module.

## Ending

- Run the command `npm run lint` and fix any TypeScript errors in the files.
- Change the status of the task to "in_progress", "done" or "failed" in this file.
- Mark this task as done in the ../utilities-ecosystem.node-cli.plan.md after completion.
- Summarize the work done and propose a git commit message in this file.
