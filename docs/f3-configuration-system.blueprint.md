# Feature F3 - Configuration System

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

The Configuration System feature provides a flexible configuration management system that supports environment variables, configuration files, and default values, allowing for easy customization of CLI application behavior.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** manage application configuration through multiple sources
- **So that:** I can easily customize and deploy my application in different environments

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Load configuration from file
    Given I have a configuration file
    When the application starts
    Then the configuration is loaded from the file
    And the values are properly parsed
    And type conversion is applied

Scenario: Override with environment variables
    Given I have configuration in both file and environment
    When the application starts
    Then environment variables take precedence
    And the merged configuration is available

Scenario: Use default values
    Given I have a configuration key without a value
    When the application needs that configuration
    Then the default value is used
    And a warning is logged if in debug mode

Scenario: Validate configuration
    Given I have invalid configuration values
    When the application starts
    Then appropriate error messages are displayed
    And the application fails gracefully
```

## UI/UX

The configuration system will be transparent to end users but provide clear feedback:

- Configuration file location and format documentation
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Debug mode to show configuration loading process
- Configuration validation feedback
- Helpful suggestions for common configuration issues

User flow:
1. System looks for configuration sources
2. System loads and merges configurations
3. System validates the configuration
4. System makes configuration available to application
5. System provides feedback on configuration status

## Additional Information

Dependencies:
- Node.js built-in modules
- Configuration management library (e.g., convict, config)

Preconditions:
- Project must be initialized
- Configuration files must follow the correct format

Notes:
- Support for multiple configuration file formats (JSON, YAML)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Configuration schema validation
- Secure handling of sensitive data (store them in git ignored files)
