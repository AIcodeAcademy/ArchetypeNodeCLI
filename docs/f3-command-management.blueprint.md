# Feature F3 - Command Management

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

The Command Management feature implements a robust command system with argument parsing, help generation, and options support, enabling developers to create and manage CLI commands efficiently.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** create and manage commands with arguments and options
- **So that:** I can provide a rich and user-friendly command-line interface for my application

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Create a new command
    Given I want to add a new command to my CLI
    When I create a command file with the required structure
    Then the command is automatically registered
    And help text is generated
    And argument parsing is configured

Scenario: Execute a command with arguments
    Given I have a command with defined arguments
    When I run the command with valid arguments
    Then the command executes successfully
    And the arguments are properly parsed
    And validation errors are handled gracefully

Scenario: Display command help
    Given I have multiple commands registered
    When I run the help command or use --help flag
    Then I see a list of available commands
    And each command shows its description and usage
    And options and arguments are documented

Scenario: Handle command errors
    Given I have a command that can fail
    When I run the command with invalid input
    Then appropriate error messages are displayed
    And the application exits with the correct status code
```

## UI/UX

The command system will provide a consistent and intuitive interface:

- Command structure: `archetype <command> [subcommand] [options] [arguments]`
- Standard help format with examples
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Progress indicators for long-running commands
- Clear error messages with suggestions

User flow:
1. User runs a command
2. System validates command syntax
3. System parses arguments and options
4. System executes the command
5. System displays results or errors

## Additional Information

Preconditions:
- Project must be initialized
- Command must be properly registered

Notes:
- Commands should be modular and self-contained
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous commands
- Built-in support for common command patterns
- Extensible command registration system
- Support for command aliases
- Tab completion support
