# Feature F1 - Project Initialization

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

The Project Initialization feature automatically sets up a new CLI project with best practices and standard structure, providing developers with a solid foundation for their CLI applications.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** developer
- **I want to:** initialize a new CLI project with a standardized structure
- **So that:** I can start developing my CLI application with best practices and consistent organization

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Initialize a new CLI project
    Given I have the required tools installed on my system
    When I run the initialization command with a project name
    Then a new project directory is created with the standard structure
    And all necessary configuration files are generated
    And the package.json is properly configured
    And basic documentation is created

Scenario: Initialize with custom options
    Given I want to customize my project setup
    When I run the initialization command with custom options
    Then the project is created with my specified configurations
    And the custom settings are properly applied

Scenario: Handle existing directory
    Given I try to initialize a project in an existing directory
    When the directory is not empty
    Then I am prompted to confirm or choose a different location
```

## UI/UX

The initialization process will be command-line based with clear prompts and feedback:

- Command syntax: `archetype init <project-name> [options]`
- Interactive prompts for required information
- Progress indicators during initialization
- Clear success/error messages
- Help text for available options

User flow:
1. User runs the initialization command
2. System validates the project name and options
3. System creates the project structure
4. System configures the project files
5. System provides completion feedback

## Additional Information

Dependencies:
- Tools installed on the system

Preconditions:
- Sufficient disk space
- Write permissions in target directory

Notes:
- The initialization process should be idempotent
- Should support both npm and yarn
- Should include a .gitignore file
- Should set up basic linting and testing configurations
