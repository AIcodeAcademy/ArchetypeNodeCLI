# Feature F5 - Output Formatting

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Offer utilities for formatting console output consistently.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** Developer using the CLI archetype
- **I want to:** Format CLI output (e.g., tables, lists, colored text)
- **So that:** The CLI provides a clear, readable, and professional user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Display data in a table
    Given the CLI needs to output structured data (e.g., a list of configurations)
    When the application uses the table formatting utility
    Then the data is displayed in a well-formatted table in the console.

Scenario: Display a list
    Given the CLI needs to output a list of items
    When the application uses the list formatting utility
    Then the items are displayed as a formatted list (e.g., bulleted or numbered).

Scenario: Display colored text for emphasis
    Given the CLI needs to output a success or error message
    When the application uses the color formatting utility
    Then the message is displayed in the appropriate color (e.g., green for success, red for error).

Scenario: Consistent formatting across commands
    Given multiple commands output information
    When these commands use the formatting utilities
    Then the output style (tables, colors, spacing) is consistent across all commands.
```

## UI/UX

Output formatting directly impacts the CLI's usability. Consistent use of tables, lists, colors, and spinners enhances readability and user experience. Standard conventions for success, error, warning, and informational messages should be used.

## Additional Information

- Consider using libraries like `chalk`. Place it in a separate adapter to hide the dependency from the rest of the codebase.
- Provide simple wrapper functions or classes within the archetype to abstract these libraries, making them easy to use for developers building on the archetype.
