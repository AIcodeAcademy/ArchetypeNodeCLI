# Feature F1 - Project Structure

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Establishes a standardized organization for the project that ensures clarity, maintainability, and scalability while providing clear guidelines for where different types of code and documentation should be placed.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** developer
- **I want to:** understand where to find and place different types of code
- **So that:** I can work efficiently and maintain consistency across the project

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Understand project organization
    Given I am new to the project
    When I look at the project structure
    Then I can easily find:
      - Source code
      - Executable files
      - Test files
      - Documentation
      - Configuration files

Scenario: Add new functionality
    Given I need to add a new feature
    When I look at the project structure
    Then I know exactly where to place:
      - New commands
      - Supporting code
      - Tests
      - Documentation

Scenario: Maintain consistency
    Given I am working on the project
    When I add or modify code
    Then I follow the established structure
    And other developers can easily find my changes
```

## UI/UX

The project structure provides clear separation of concerns:

- Source code organization
  - Command implementations
  - Core business logic
  - Shared utilities
  - Type definitions
- Executable files
- Test organization
- Documentation structure

## Additional Information

Preconditions:
- Project initialization
- Development environment setup

Notes:
- Structure supports team collaboration
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable for future growth
- Consistent with industry best practices
