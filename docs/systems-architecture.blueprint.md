## Overview

ArchetypeNodeCLI is a command-line interface (CLI) application built with Node.js and TypeScript, designed to provide a standardized foundation for building CLI applications. The system focuses on three core features: configuration management, structured logging, and interactive commands. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns and type safety throughout the codebase.

## System Containers

Here is the list of containers at a glance. See below for more details.

- **C1-node-cli** : A Node.js CLI application that provides configuration management, logging, and interactive command capabilities

## C1 : Node CLI

- **Tier**: backend
