# Feature F4 - Logging and Error Handling

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

The Logging and Error Handling feature implements a comprehensive logging system with different verbosity levels and robust error handling, ensuring reliable operation and effective debugging of CLI applications.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** implement logging and error handling
- **So that:** I can monitor application behavior and handle errors gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Log messages with different levels
    Given I have configured logging levels
    When I log messages with different severity
    Then messages are filtered according to the configured level
    And messages include appropriate metadata
    And messages are formatted consistently

Scenario: Handle application errors
    Given an error occurs during execution
    When the error is caught by the error handler
    Then an appropriate error message is displayed
    And the error is logged with stack trace
    And the application exits with the correct status code

Scenario: Configure logging output
    Given I want to change logging behavior
    When I configure logging settings
    Then logs are written to the specified output
    And the format is updated accordingly
    And the changes take effect immediately

Scenario: Debug mode operation
    Given I enable debug mode
    When the application runs
    Then detailed logs are generated
    And performance metrics are included
    And sensitive data is properly masked
```

## UI/UX

The logging system will provide clear and consistent output:

- Color-coded log levels for better visibility
- Consistent log format with timestamps
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Debug mode toggle with --debug flag

User flow:
1. System initializes logging
2. System processes log messages
3. System formats and outputs logs
4. System handles errors appropriately
5. System provides feedback on operation status

## Additional Information

Preconditions:
- Project must be initialized
- Configuration system must be implemented
- Logging configuration must be valid

Notes:
- Support for multiple log transports (console, file)
- Structured logging format
- Log rotation and retention policies
