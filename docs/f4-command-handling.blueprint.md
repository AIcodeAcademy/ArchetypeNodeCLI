# Feature F4 - Command Handling

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Implement a basic command structure, including a help command to list available commands.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** Developer using the CLI archetype
- **I want to:** Define and execute distinct commands with arguments and options
- **So that:** I can structure the CLI's functionality logically and provide a clear user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Run the default help command
    Given the CLI application is installed
    When the user runs the application with a help flag (e.g., `--help` or `-h`) or no command
    Then the application displays a list of available commands and global options.

Scenario: Run a specific command
    Given the CLI has a command defined (e.g., `config:get`)
    When the user runs `cli config:get setting_name`
    Then the logic associated with the `config:get` command is executed with `setting_name` as an argument.

Scenario: Run a command with options
    Given the CLI has a command defined that accepts options (e.g., `process --force`)
    When the user runs `cli process --force`
    Then the command logic is executed, and it recognizes that the `force` option is enabled.

Scenario: Display help for a specific command
    Given the CLI has a command defined (e.g., `config:set`)
    When the user runs `cli config:set --help`
    Then the application displays detailed help for the `config:set` command, including its arguments and options.
```

## UI/UX

Interaction is via the command line. The CLI should follow standard conventions for arguments, options (e.g., `--option`, `-o`), and help flags. Help messages should be clear and informative.

## Additional Information

- Use a library like `commander` to simplify command parsing, argument handling, and help generation. Place the references in a separate adapter to hide the dependency from the rest of the codebase.
- Establish a clear naming convention for commands (e.g., `noun:verb`).
