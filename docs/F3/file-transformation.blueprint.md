# Feature F3 - File Transformation

Feature Code: F3_file-transformation

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Read files from source folder/file, transform content, write to target folders/files based on configurable paths.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** easily read, transform, and write files across multiple directories
- **So that:** I can create tools for code generation, file migration, or content processing tasks

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Read files from a source directory
    Given source directory paths are configured in the application
    When the file transformation feature is invoked to read files
    Then all matching files are correctly loaded with their content and metadata

Scenario: Apply transformations to file content
    Given one or more files have been loaded from a source location
    When transformation functions are applied to the file content
    Then the content is modified according to the transformation rules while maintaining the file structure

Scenario: Write transformed files to target locations
    Given files have been loaded and transformed
    When the write operation is executed with target path configuration
    Then the transformed files are written to the correct target locations
    
Scenario: Handle file operation errors gracefully
    Given file operations may encounter permissions or I/O errors
    When an error occurs during reading, transforming, or writing files
    Then the error is properly caught and reported with contextual information
```

## UI/UX

The file transformation system will provide a functional API for file operations that handles common edge cases and provides detailed feedback. It will support glob patterns for file selection, custom transformation pipelines, and parallel processing for efficiency.

```markdown
- File reading:
  - Support for globbing patterns to select files
  - Options for recursive directory traversal
  - Metadata preservation during operations
  
- Content transformation:
  - Pipeline-based transformation system
  - Built-in transformers for common operations (search/replace, template rendering)
  - Support for custom transformation functions
  
- File writing:
  - Path mapping between source and target locations
  - Directory creation if target doesn't exist
  - Options for overwrite protection
```

## Additional Information

Dependencies:
- Built on Node.js native fs/promises API with minimal external dependencies
- May use path and glob modules for path handling and pattern matching

The file transformation feature builds upon the utility ecosystem (F1) and can be accessed through the command processing system (F2). It represents the main application functionality that demonstrates the capabilities of the archetype CLI framework.

Example use cases:
- Copying and renaming coding-rule files from a source to several targets
- Generating code from templates
- Batch processing of text files
