# Feature F2 - Command Handling

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Provides a system for defining, parsing, and executing commands with proper validation and documentation, ensuring consistent and reliable command execution across the application.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** user
- **I want to:** execute commands with confidence
- **So that:** I can perform tasks efficiently and correctly

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Execute a command
    Given I have a valid command
    When I execute the command
    Then the command is processed correctly
    And the expected action is performed
    And I receive appropriate feedback

Scenario: Handle invalid input
    Given I provide incorrect command input
    When I attempt to execute the command
    Then I receive clear guidance on the error
    And suggestions for correct usage
    And the command does not execute

Scenario: Get command help

    When I request help
    Then I receive comprehensive documentation including:
      - Command purpose
      - Required and optional parameters
      - Usage examples
      - Related commands

Scenario: Use command shortcuts
    Given I know a command shortcut
    When I use the shortcut
    Then the command executes as if I used the full command
