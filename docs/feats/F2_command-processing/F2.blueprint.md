# Feature F2 - **command-processing**

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)

## Description

Adapters for processing commands and formatting outputs with minimal external dependencies.

## Goal / User Story

- **As a:** CLI application developer
- **I want to:** have a standardized system for defining, processing commands, and formatting outputs
- **So that:** I can build consistent command-line interfaces with proper argument parsing and readable output

## Acceptance Criteria / Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Define and parse CLI commands and options
    Given a CLI application needs to handle multiple commands with different options
    When the developer defines commands using the command processing adapters
    Then the user input is correctly parsed and routed to the appropriate command handlers

Scenario: Format command output for better readability
    Given a command execution produces data to be displayed to the user
    When the output formatter is used to present the data
    Then the information is displayed in a structured, readable format with optional color highlighting

Scenario: Handle command errors gracefully
    Given a command might encounter errors during execution
    When an error occurs during command processing
    Then the error is captured, formatted appropriately, and displayed to the user with relevant context
```

## UI/UX

The command processing system will provide a clean, declarative way to define commands and their options, with automatic help generation, validation, and error handling. Output formatting will support different styles (table, list, JSON) with consistent visual presentation.

```markdown
- Command definition:
  - Declarative API to define commands, options, and arguments
  - Built-in help text generation and validation
  - Command grouping for complex applications
  
- Command execution:
  - Centralized command processing pipeline
  - Consistent error handling and reporting
  - Support for asynchronous command execution
  
- Output formatting:
  - Table format for structured data
  - List format for sequential information
  - Basic text highlighting using chalk
  - Support for different verbosity levels
```

## Additional Information

Dependencies:
- Commander library for parsing command line arguments and options
- Chalk library for colorized terminal output

The command processing system will leverage the utilities from F1 for logging and configuration. It should provide a high-level abstraction over the Commander library to maintain flexibility while offering a more standardized and type-safe interface.
