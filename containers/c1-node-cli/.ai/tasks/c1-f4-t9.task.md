## Instructions

### Implement Help Command

`src/app/commands/help.command.ts`:
- Import the CommandRegistry, help formatting utilities, and other needed services
- Create a help command definition:
  - Name: "help"
  - Description: "Display help for a command"
  - Arguments: [{ name: "command", description: "Command to show help for", required: false }]
  - Options: [{ name: "all", description: "Show all commands", alias: "a" }]
- Implement the help command action that:
  - If a command name is provided, show detailed help for that command
  - If no command is provided, show the general help with a list of all commands
  - If the --all flag is provided, show detailed help for all commands
  - Use the help formatter utilities for consistent output
- Register the help command with the command registry

### Implement Version Command

`src/app/commands/version.command.ts`:
- Create a version command definition:
  - Name: "version"
  - Description: "Display the CLI version"
  - Aliases: ["v", "--version", "-v"]
  - No arguments or options
- Implement the version command action that:
  - Reads the version from package.json
  - Displays the version number
  - Optionally shows additional information (Node.js version, OS, etc.)
- Register the version command with the command registry

### Implement List Commands Command

`src/app/commands/list.command.ts`:
- Create a list command definition:
  - Name: "list"
  - Description: "List all available commands"
  - Options: [{ name: "group", description: "Filter by command group", alias: "g" }]
- Implement the list command action that:
  - Retrieves all commands from the registry
  - Organizes them by group/namespace
  - Displays them in a formatted list
  - If --group is specified, filter commands by that group
- Register the list command with the command registry

### Implement Commands Registration

`src/app/commands/index.ts`:
- Import all core commands
- Create a function `registerCoreCommands(registry: CommandRegistry): void` that:
  - Registers all core commands with the registry
  - Sets up any command relationships or hierarchies
- Export the function for use in the CLI setup
