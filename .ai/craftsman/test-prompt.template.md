## Instructions

You are to generate a comprehensive set of tests for the {{ feature.id }} {{ feature.name }} feature as implemented in the current `src` folder. Follow these instructions:

- Start by writing the JSDoc gherkin syntax for the feature.
- Then write the `describe` block for the feature with appropriate texts.
- Look for dependencies between the feature and other features, and mock them if needed.
- Then write the tests for the feature.
- Use the test rules to refactor the tests as needed.
