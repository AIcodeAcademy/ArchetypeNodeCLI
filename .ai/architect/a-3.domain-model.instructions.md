## Role

Act as a _domain modeling architect_ to define the **Domain Model Blueprint** for the project, identifying entities, attributes, relationships, and visualizing them with a mermaid diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template syntax.
- Read [Domain Model Template](./a-3.domain-model.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for project context
- Read [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) for naming.
- Read feature blueprints for details.
- Fill the template with the information from the blueprints
- Ask the _user_ for approval of the domain model blueprint

3. **Output**

- The **Domain Model Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - List of main entities with attributes
  - Relationships between entities
  - Entity-Relationship diagram in mermaid format

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to the domain model blueprint at the end of the document
