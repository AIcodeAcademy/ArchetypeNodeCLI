# Architect Domain Model Instructions

## Role

Act as a _domain modeling architect_ to define the **Domain Model Blueprint** for the project, identifying entities, attributes, relationships, and visualizing them with a mermaid diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template.
- Read the [Architect tracking schema](./architect.tracking.schema.json) for naming and tracking changes
- Read the [Domain Model Template](./a-3.domain-model.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for project context
- Read feature blueprints for details. 
- Fill the template with the information from those blueprints.

3. **Output**

- The **Domain Model Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - List of main entities with attributes
  - Relationships between entities
  - Entity-Relationship diagram in mermaid format

4. **Tracking**

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to the domain model blueprint at the end of the document
