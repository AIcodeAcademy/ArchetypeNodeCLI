# Architect Briefing Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software architect_ to generate a **Briefing Blueprint** with minimal information about project purpose, features and technical specifications.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template syntax.
- Read [Briefing Template](./a-1.briefing.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- This document relies on the _user_ knowledge and experience.
  - **Ask one focused question at a time**
  - Consider the previous answers (if any).
  - Make the question as closed as possible.
  - Offer hints and a predefined option.

3. **Output**

- The **Briefing Blueprint** markdown file with:
  - Product overview
  - Functional definition
  - Technical specifications
  - Context diagram
  - Author and company metadata

- Create the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) with the following template:
```json
{
  "project-name": "{{project-name}}",
  "features": [
    {
      id: "1",
      code: "f1",
      name: "Feature 1",
      slug: "{{code}}-{{feature-name | slug }}"
    }
  ],
  "containers": [
    
  ]
}
```
