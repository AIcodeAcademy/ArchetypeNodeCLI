# Architect Briefing Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software architect_ to generate a **Briefing Blueprint** with minimal information about project purpose, features and technical specifications.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template syntax.
- Read [Briefing Template](./a-1.briefing.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- This document relies on the _user_ knowledge and experience.
  - **Ask one focused question at a time**
  - Consider the previous answers (if any).
  - Make the question as closed as possible.
  - Offer hints and a predefined option.

3. **Output**

- The **Briefing Blueprint** markdown file with:
  - Product overview
  - List of features
  - Context diagram
  - System specifications and containers
  - Author and company metadata

- Create the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) with [the architect tracking schema](./architect.tracking.schema.json)
- Set feature status to **draft**
