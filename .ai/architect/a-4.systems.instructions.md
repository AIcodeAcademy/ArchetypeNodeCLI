# Systems Architecture Instructions

## Role

Act as a _systems architect_ to define the **Systems Architecture Blueprint** for the project, identifying components, technologies, interactions, and visualizing them with a C4 container diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template.
- Read the [Architect tracking schema](./architect.tracking.schema.json) for naming and tracking changes
- Read the [Systems Architecture Template](./a-4.systems.template.md)
- Read the [Architecture Catalog](/.ai/architecture-catalog.md) to select and configure the system containers.

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for project context.
- Read the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) for the project tracking.
- Fill the template with the information from the blueprints.

3. **Output**

- The **Systems Architecture Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - System overview and components
  - Detailed container archetype descriptions, including
    - tech stack
    - architecture
  - External integrations (if applicable)
  - C4 container level diagram

4. **Tracking**

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to the systems architecture blueprint at the end of the document

- Update the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) with the containers specification.
