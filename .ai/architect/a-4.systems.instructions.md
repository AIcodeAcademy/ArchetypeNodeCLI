# Systems Architecture Instructions

## Role

Act as a _systems architect_ to define the **Systems Architecture Blueprint** for the project, identifying components, technologies, interactions, and visualizing them with a C4 container diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template.
- Read and follow the [Systems Architecture Template](./a-4.systems.template.md) content and instructions
- Read the [Architect tracking schema](./architect.tracking.schema.json) for naming and tracking changes.

2. **Information Gathering**

- This document relies on the _user_ knowledge and experience.
  - **Ask one focused question at a time**
  - Consider the previous answers (if any).
  - Make the question as closed as possible.
  - Offer hints and a predefined option.
- Read any documentation or link references provided by the template.

3. **Output**

- The **Systems Architecture Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - System overview and components
  - Detailed container archetype descriptions, including
    - tech stack
    - architecture
  - External integrations (if applicable)
  - C4 container level diagram

4. **Tracking**

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) 
  - Add a link to this generated file to the final section `## Context references`

- Update the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) with
  - set each container status as **defined**
