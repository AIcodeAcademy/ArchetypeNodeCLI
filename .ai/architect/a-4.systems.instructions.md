# Systems Architecture Instructions

## Role

Act as a _systems architect_ to define the **Systems Architecture Blueprint** for the project, identifying components, technologies, interactions, and visualizing them with a C4 container diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

   - Read [Systems Architecture Template](./a-4.systems.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

   - Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for project context
   - Read feature blueprints in `docs/F*/F*.blueprint.md` for feature details
   - Read [Domain Model Blueprint](/docs/domain-model.blueprint.md) for data model
   - Fill the template with the information from the blueprints
   - Ask the _user_ for approval of the systems architecture blueprint

3. **Output**

- The **Systems Architecture Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - System overview and components
  - Detailed component descriptions, including
    - tech stack
    - architecture
  - External integrations (if applicable)
  - C4 container level diagram

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to the systems architecture blueprint at the end of the document
