# Systems Architecture Instructions

## Role

Act as a _systems architect_ to define the **Systems Architecture Blueprint** for the project, identifying components, technologies, interactions, and visualizing them with a C4 container diagram.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template syntax.
- Read [Systems Architecture Template](./a-4.systems.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for project context.
- Read [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) for naming.
- Read feature blueprints for details.
- Fill the template with the information from the blueprints.
- Ask the _user_ for approval of the systems architecture blueprint.

3. **Output**

- The **Systems Architecture Blueprint** markdown file with:

  - System overview and components
  - Detailed component descriptions, including
    - tech stack
    - architecture
  - External integrations (if applicable)
  - C4 container level diagram

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to the systems architecture blueprint at the end of the document

- Update the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json)  with the containers specification
```json
{
  "project_name": "{{project_name}}",
  "features": [],
  "containers": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "code": "C1",
      "archetype": "{{container-archetype}}",
      "name": "{{archetype | Title Case}}",
      "slug": "{{code}}-{{archetype | slug}}",
    }
  ],
}
```
