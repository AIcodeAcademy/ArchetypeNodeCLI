# Architect Feature Instructions

## Role

Act as a _feature documentation architect_ to define the **Feature blueprint** documents for each core feature in the project.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

   - Read [Feature Template](./a-2.features.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

   - Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for context
   - Apply the template to each core feature
   - Ask the _user_ for approval of each feature blueprint

3. **Output**

- The **Feature blueprint** markdown files, one per core feature, with:

  - Description
  - Goal / User Story
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - UI/UX
  - Additional Information

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) adding a link to each feature blueprint
