# Architect Feature Instructions

## Role

Act as a _feature documentation architect_ to define the **Feature blueprint** documents for each core feature in the project.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

- Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template.
- Read the [Architect tracking schema](./architect.tracking.schema.json) for naming and tracking changes
- Read the [Feature Template](./a-2.features.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for context.
- Apply the template to each core feature.

3. **Output**

- The **Feature blueprint** markdown files, one per core feature, with:

  - Description
  - Goal / User Story
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - UI/UX
  - Additional Information


4. **Tracking**

- Update the [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) ensuring a link to each feature blueprint is ok at each feature section.

- Update the [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) with
  - the feature files path
  - the feature status as **defined**
