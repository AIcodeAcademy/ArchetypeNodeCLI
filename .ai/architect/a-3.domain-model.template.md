# Data Model for **{{ projectName }}**

This document describes the data model for the **{{ projectName }}** project. It covers the primary entities, their attributes, relationships, and provides a visual representation using a Entity-Relationship diagram.

It aims to establish a shared understanding (ubiquitous language) for business logic and system design.

Most of those entities will be persisted or loaded from a repository, but this is not a requirement. The data model is a conceptual representation of the system's structure and behavior. Include whatever you think is relevant for the project.

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)
{{ for feature in features }}
-  [{{ feature name }}](/docs/{{ feature-slug }}.blueprint.md)
{{ end feature }}

<!--This is the most critical part of the data model.
- Think deeply about the entities and their relationships.
- Evaluate 2-3 options and choose the simplest one.
- After having the entities, think about the attributes.
- Then write the entities and relationships following the template below.
-->

## Entities

{{ for entity in entities }}

### {{ entity.name | PascalCase }}

- **Description**: {{ entity.description }}
- **Attributes**:
  <!--
  If attribute is optional add ? suffix to the attribute name
  If attribute is unique add ! suffix to the attribute name
  -->
  {{ for attribute in entity.attributes }}
  - **{{ attribute.name | camelCase }}**: {{ attribute.type }}
    {{ end attribute }}

{{ end entity }}

## Relationships

<!--
Mention the entity that participates in the relationship
Express cardinality and participation using natural language
-->

{{ for relationship in relationships }}

- {{ relationship description  | one short sentence }}

{{ end relationship }}

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

<!--Example of a mermaid diagram:
erDiagram
    Customer ||--o{ Order : places
    Order ||--|{ LineItem : contains
    Customer }|..|{ DeliveryAddress : uses
-->

```mermaid
{{ entity relationship diagram | mermaid diagram }}
```
