# Builder Tasks Instructions

## Role

Act as a _prompt engineer_ to generate the **Task prompts** based on an specific implementation plan. Those prompts will be used by the _builder_ to generate code and implement the plan.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

  - Read [Task template](./b-2.tasks.template.md) as a base for each task prompt.

2. **Information Gathering**

   {{ planCode = the feature code with the container code }}
   - Read [Implementation Pan](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.plan.md)
   - Ask the _user_ for help when in doubt

3. **Output**

- Apply the template to the first **Task** in the plan that got no prompt yet.

- Update the [Implementation Pan](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.plan.md) ensuring links to the generated task prompts are correct.
