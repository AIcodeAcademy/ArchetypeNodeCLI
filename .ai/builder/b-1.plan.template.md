## Description  

This is a plan for implementing the feature {{ feature.name }} at container {{ container.name }}.

{{ description and goals | one paragraph }}

## Plan implementation tasks

<!--
Think about the implementation tasks at each layer bottom up.
At this level, the tasks are not detailed. Just the high level steps to be done.
Elaborate two or three different approaches and choose the simplest one.
Add a correlative number for the task, ex: 1, 2
If you end having more than 9 tasks, group them in just 9 or less tasks.
Ideally you should have 3 to 7 tasks at this level.
-->

{{ for layer in layers }}

### {{ layer.name | titlecase }}

<!--
  Generate a list of tasks to be done at this layer.
  Ideally 1 to 3 tasks per layer. Never more than 5.
-->
{{ for task in tasks }}
- [ ] {{task.number}}. {{ task.description | one sentence }}
{{ end task}}

<!--
  Refine the tasks list at this layer, looking for inconsistencies and dependencies.
  Change numbering to reflect the new order
-->

{{ end layer}}

<!--
  Refine all the generated tasks list looking for potential invalid layer dependencies.
  Change numbering to reflect the new order.
  Ensure numbers are correlative and sequential from the beginning of the list. No restarting at every layer.
-->

## Bill of materials

<!--
Think about the resources needed to implement the feature.
A resource can be :
  - an external dependency
  - configuration or environment files
  - any other data file or service
-->

{{ for resource in resources }}
- `{{resource.name}}`: {{resource.description}}
{{ end resource}}
