# Implementation Plan for {{ feature.name | titlecase }} at {{ container.name | titlecase }}

- **Container**: {{ container.slug }}
- **Feature**: {{ feature.slug }}
- **Plan**: {{ container.slug }}-{{ feature.slug }}

## Description

This plan outlines the implementation of {{ feature.name }} at {{ container.name }} container. The implementation will follow the layered architecture pattern and ensure proper separation of concerns.

## Plan Implementation Tasks

<!--
Think about the implementation tasks at each layer top down.
At this level, the tasks are not detailed. Just the high level steps to be done.
Elaborate two or three different approaches and choose the simplest one.
Ideally you should have 3 to 7 tasks. Never more than 9.
-->

{{ for layer in layers }}

### {{ layer.name | titlecase }} Layer

<!--
  Generate a list of tasks to be done at this layer.
  Ideally 1 to 3 tasks per layer. Never more than 5.
-->
{{ for task in tasks }}
- [ ] {{ task.number }}. {{ task.description | one sentence }}
{{ end task }}

{{ end layer }}

<!--
  Refine all the generated tasks list looking for potential invalid layer dependencies.
  Rewrite the layers list in bottom up order to build upon the previous layer.
  Add a correlative number for the task, ex: 1, 2, 
  Ensure numbers are correlative and sequential from the beginning to the end of the list.
  No restarting at every layer.
-->

## Bill of Materials

<!--
Think about the resources needed to implement the feature.
A resource can be:
  - an external dependency
  - configuration or environment files
  - any other data file or service
-->

{{ for resource in resources }}
- `{{ resource.name }}`: {{ resource.description }}
{{ end resource }}
