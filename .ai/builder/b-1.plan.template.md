### Reference

<!--
  Read the following documents to understand the feature and the container.
  Be sure to read the archetype rules to fully understand:
  - The language and framework used
  - The layers of the container
  - The architecture of the container
-->

## Description  

This is a plan for implementing the feature {{ feature.name }} at container {{ container.name }}.

{{ description and goals | one paragraph }}

## Plan implementation tasks

<!--
Think about the implementation tasks at each layer bottom up.
At this level, the tasks are not detailed. Just the high level steps to be done.
Elaborate two or three different approaches and choose the simplest one.
Add a correlative number for the task, ex: 1, 2
-->

{{ for layer in layers }}

### #. {{ layer Name }}

<!--
  Generate a list of tasks to be done at this layer
-->
{{ for task in tasks }}
- [ ] {{task.number}}. {{ task.description | one sentence }}
{{ end task}}

<!--
  Refine the tasks list at this layer, looking for inconsistencies and dependencies.
  Change numbering to reflect the new order
-->

{{ end layer}}

<!--
  Refine all the generated tasks list looking for potential invalid layer dependencies.
  Change numbering to reflect the new order
-->

## Bill of materials

<!--
Think about the resources needed to implement the feature.
A resource can be :
  - an external dependency
  - configuration or environment files
  - any other data file or service
-->

{{ for resource in resources }}
- `{{resource.name}}`: {{resource.description}}
{{ end resource}}
