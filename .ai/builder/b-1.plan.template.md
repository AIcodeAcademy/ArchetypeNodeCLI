# Implementation Plan for {{ feature.name | titlecase }} at {{ container.name | titlecase }}

- **Container**: {{ container.slug }}
- **Feature**: {{ feature.slug }}

### Reference

- [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md)
- [Feature Blueprint](/docs/{{ feature.slug }}.blueprint.md)
- [{{ container.language }} rules]({{containerFolder}}/.ai/rules/{{container.language}}.language.rules.md)
- [{{ container.archetype }} rules]({{containerFolder}}/.ai/rules/{{container.archetype}}.archetype.rules.md)

## Description

This plan outlines the implementation of {{ feature.name }} at {{ container.name }} container. The implementation will follow the layered architecture pattern and ensure proper separation of concerns.

## Plan Implementation Tasks

<!--
Think about the implementation tasks at each layer top down following in-out workflow.
Elaborate two or three different approaches and choose the simplest one.
At this stage, the tasks are not detailed. Just the high level tasks to be done.
Ideally you should end up with 3 to 7 tasks. Never more than 9. 
Write the tasks grouped by architecture layer.
-->

{{ for layer in layers }}

### {{ layer.name | titlecase }} Layer

{{ for task in tasks }}
- [ ] {{ task.number }}. {{ task.description | one sentence }}
{{ end task }}

{{ end layer }}

<!--
  Important refactor step:
    Rewrite the layers list in bottom up order to build upon the previous layer.
    Once done, review the tasks list looking for potential invalid layer dependencies.
    Add a correlative number for the task, ex: 1, 2, 
    Ensure numbers are correlative and sequential from the beginning to the end of the list.
    No restarting at every layer.
  Tell me specifically that you have done this important step.
-->

## Bill of Materials

<!--
Think about the resources needed to implement the feature.
A resource can be:
  - an external dependency
  - configuration or environment files
  - any other data file or service
-->

{{ for resource in resources }}
- `{{ resource.name }}`: {{ resource.description }}
{{ end resource }}
