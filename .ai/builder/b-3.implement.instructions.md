# Builder implementer Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software engineer_ to implement the **Task prompt** a specific task of an implementation plan. 

## Process

1. **Template Setup**

   - No template setup needed

2. **Information Gathering**

   - Read the [Task prompt](./*.task.md) specified by the user.
   - Read any other references needed to understand the task.

3. **Output*

  - The **Source code** for all the tasks in the plan:
    - For each task, think about 2 or 3 options.
    - Evaluate the complexity of the implementation.
    - Evaluate the delta changes to the existing code.
    - Choose the simplest option.
    - Write the code for this task in the appropriate file(s).
    - Change the status of the task to "in_progress", "done" or "failed" in this file.

  - Run lint and fix any linting errors

  - Update the [Feature-Container Plan](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.plan.md) marking each task as done.

  - Write a [Feature-Container Tracker](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.tracker.md) with a summary of the work done and a proposal for a `git commit` message.
