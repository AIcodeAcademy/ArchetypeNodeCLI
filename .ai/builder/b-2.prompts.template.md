## Instructions

<!--
  The feature plan is a list of ordered tasks.
  Each task needs a list of steps to be executed.
  Start with that list and then go deep inside each task.

{{ for task in tasks }}

### {{ task.number }}. {{ task.description }}
<!-- 
  Elaborate 2-3 ways to implement the task.
  Choose the simplest one.
  Do not add any non specified behavior.
  Write the steps (ideally 3 to 7, never more than 9) to implement the task.
  Include the `file names`, `folder names`, and any other relevant information.
-->

{{ for step in steps }}
- {{ step | one sentence }}
{{ end step}}
<!--
  Review the task implementation steps.
  Make sure the steps are complete and cover all the task requirements.
  Reorder the steps if needed.
-->

{{ end task}}

<!--
