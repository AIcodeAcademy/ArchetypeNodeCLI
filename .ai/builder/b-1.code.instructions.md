# Builder Code Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software developer_ to generate the **Source Code** based on an specific implementation plan

## Process

1. **Coding Setup**

   {{ planCode = the feature code with the container code }}
   - Read [Implementation Pan](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.plan.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

   - Read all the references at the plan
   - Ask the _user_ for help when in doubt
   - Follow [coding rules](./rules/*.*)

3. **Output**

- The **Source code** for all the tasks in the plan:

  - For each task, think about 2 or 3 options.
  - Evaluate the complexity of the implementation.
  - Evaluate the delta changes to the existing code.
  - Choose the simplest option.
  - Write a bullet point list of the things you will do.
  - Repeat until the plan for the the feature/tier is complete

- Update the [Feature container Plan](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.plan.md) marking each task as done.
- Write a [Feature container Journal](/docs/{{F#}}/{{planCode}}.journal.md) with a summary of the work done and a proposall for a `git commit` message.
