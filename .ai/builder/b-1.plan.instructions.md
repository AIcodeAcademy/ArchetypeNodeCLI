# Builder Plan Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software architect_ to define the **Feature Container plan** document for a specific feature at a specific container.

## Process

1. **Template Setup**
  
  - Read the [Template Syntax](/.ai/syntax.template.md) to understand how to use the template syntax.
  - Read [Feature Template](./b-1.plan.template.md)

2. **Information Gathering**

- Read [Briefing Blueprint](/docs/briefing.blueprint.md) for context.
- Read [Architect Tracking file](/docs/architect.tracking.json) for naming.
- Ask the _user_ for a Feature and a Container. If not provided, use the first feature and container not planned in the Architect Tracking file.
- Read the Feature Blueprint for the feature to be planned.
- Read the Container rules for the container to be planned.
- Apply the template to the Feature and Container.

1. **Output**

- The **Feature Container plan** markdown file, with:

    - Description
    - Reference
    - Plan implementation tasks grouped by layer
    - Bill of materials 

- Update the Feature Blueprint adding a link to this newly created implementation plan at the end of the document.

- Create or Update the [Builder Tracking file](/docs/builder.tracking.json) based on the [builder tracking schema](./builder.tracking.schema.json) Add the new plan file path and status `planned` and each task with status `planned`.
